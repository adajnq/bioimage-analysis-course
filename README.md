# Welcome to the Bioimage Analysis Course Repository! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the Bioimage Analysis course! This repository is designed to guide you through the essential techniques and Python tools used in bioimage analysis.

Throughout this course, you'll learn about:

- **Image Data Representation:** How to read and interpret image data, including pixel values and their relationship with biological observations.
- **Image Indexing & File Types:** Different image formats, compression methods, and their implications on data storage and analysis.
- **Bit Depth:** Understanding how the bit depth of an image affects data representation and precision.
- **Segmentation:** Techniques to separate relevant features from the background to focus on the objects of interest in biological images.
- **Data Quantification & Normalization:** Methods for measuring and normalizing data to ensure meaningful comparisons and accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Approaches to explore and visualize image data effectively.
- **Cell Phenotyping:** How to classify and analyze cells based on their characteristics.
- **Spatial Metrics:** Techniques for analyzing the spatial arrangement of features within images to gain insights into cellular and tissue organization.

## In this repository, you'll find:

- **Course Materials:** Lecture notes and slides to help you grasp key concepts.
- **Assignments and Exercises:** Python scripts and other coding challenges to practice bioimage analysis. You'll also find the solved versions of these exercises to aid your learning.
- **Environment Setup:** A `.yml` file to quickly install all necessary packages.
- **Installation Instructions:** A step-by-step guide to set up your environment from scratch, including instructions for installing GIT, VS Code, and Python.
- **Additional Resources:** Links to further readings, software tools, and references to deepen your understanding.
